                <p className="About-p-1">Hey there! My name is Dylan and I like to make things. When I was a kid those things were mostly made with Lego bricks and a young boy's imaginings. Now they're made with sweat, computer speak and a slightly older boy's dreams!</p>
                <p className="About-p-2">Back then I wanted to be a space cowboy. Unfortunately I couldn't find many openings, so I went to school and became a chemist instead. I worked in the manufacturing industry for a awhile, met a lot of wonderful people and learned a lot! Throughout this time my interest in programming grew; I created a few websites (some good, some not so good), watched countless tutorials, memorized keyboard shortcuts, and never stopped learning. Fast-forward a few years and I've rocketed through a full career transition to software development!</p>
